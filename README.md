# Blockfish
This mod adds a new creature called the flockfish. The flockfish spawns in both the lukewarm ocean and warm ocean biomes.

## Behavior
The flockfish will spawn in groups of 2-6 and will behave like any other fish.

## The Amazing Feature
These flockfish are hungry little fellas and will eat an entire cake in one bite! Upon consumption, the flockfish will rapidly expand into a fish-shaped block and sink to the ocean floor.
